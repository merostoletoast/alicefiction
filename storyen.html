    <p><span style="background-color: #faf3ea;"><u>Ep. 2: Being a Partner</u><br><br>You and Andersen come across Lancelot while exploring the Waste Area. Lancelot 
        scorns you for abandoning Neu as your partner and taking on a new one. But this misunderstanding is surprisingly cleared up by Andersen's mysterious prose

    <p><span style="background-color: #faf3ea;"><u>Ep. 3: A Man of Few Words</u><br><br>You run into Momochi and Andromeda in the Waste Area. Your face gives away your

    <p><span style="background-color: #faf3ea;"><u>Ep. 4: The Will to Accept</u><br><br>Even with an advantage in numbers, you are severely beaten by Momochi and 
        Andromeda. Lancelot notes that you probably aren't getting what Momochi is trying to teach you, but Momochi, ever a man of few words, explains nothing and even

    <p><span style="background-color: #faf3ea;"><u>Ep. 2: Neu's Past</u><br><br>As you continue to feel guilty for getting Neu hurt, she tells you about her own 
        experience about a time when she lost her memory. Neu's words seem to overlap with the mysterious girl you met when you were logging in, but Neu says that wasn't 
        her. Just then, you both hear a woman's scream in the distance.</span></p><br><br>
    <p><span style="background-color: #faf3ea;"><u>Ep. 3: Chaos Downtown</u><br><br>You come running to the streets of downtown to a scene of destroyed trash bins and

    <p><span style="background-color: #faf3ea;"><u>Ep. 4: Folklore Filter</u><br><br>While cleaning up the pawns in the city, you receive a communication from Momochi. 
        He tells you that a restriction on the area is preventing Folklore from entering. Once you meet up, Momochi quickly realizes the area around the Chronograph is 
        unaffected by the restriction and creates a tool to enhance its range. Now able to enter the field, Musashi and the others join you in the fight.</span></p><br><br>
    <p><span style="background-color: #faf3ea;"><u>Ep. 5: A Conflict Employee ID</u><br><br>After taking care of the pawns, Andromeda picks up an employee ID card. It 
        turns out to be from Conflict, the company that backs Tempest. You head over to the library with Neu to look up information on the events that just took place 
        and find a bunch of incorrect rumors. A mysterious message comes your way that says "Don't talk about that here".</span></p><br><br>

    <p><span style="background-color: #faf3ea;"><u>Ep. 1: The Facts and the Press</u><br><br>The incident which flooded the downtown area was reported to be 
        "the fault of a few troublemakers". The destruction of trash bins is also attributed to these troublemakers and their contracted Folklore which has Neu outraged.

    <p><span style="background-color: #faf3ea;"><u>Ep. 2: A Study of Memory</u><br><br>The data that Momochi analyzed was his own memory. The results of his findings 
        were that there were images in his memory data which he had never seen. Soga says that based on these results it's safe to say that "false memories" were 
        implanted. Furthermore, the surprising truth is revealed that one who can perform such a procedure is The Queen.</span></p><br><br>
    <p><span style="background-color: #faf3ea;"><u>Ep. 3: The Teachings of Lancelot</u><br><br>The friction between you and Momochi needs to be resolved but you

    <p><span style="background-color: #faf3ea;"><u>Ep. 4: Reflection</u><br><br>Based on Lancelot's advice, you and Neu reflect on what Momochi was trying to tell you. 
        You come to the realization that had you not let the Soulgorger go free, the major attack downtown wouldn't have happened. At the time, the two of you hadn't 
        even considered the ramifications of your actions but now you finally understand the reason behind Momochi's anger.</span></p><br><br>
    <p><span style="background-color: #faf3ea;"><u>Ep. 5: Momochi's Past</u><br><br>After coming to understand Momochi's true intentions, Andromeda tells you about 
        Momochi's past and regrets. You and Neu, hoping to turn over a new leaf with the realizations you've had, head to the Waste Area. There, you encounter Lancelot

    <p><span style="background-color: #faf3ea;"><u>Ep. 6: How to Make a Soulgorger</u><br><br>You and your allies flee into the Central System to escape the siege of 
        pawns. Lancelot informs you that Kanryusai was trying to get the pawns to eat a Folklore and Lancelot was attacked trying to save them. Furthermore, you hear a 
        rumor that someone in Tempest was talking about how to make a Soulgorger.</span></p><br><br>

        After calming her down, you learn that she was talking about the white Soulgorger, so you and Neu return to the Waste Area to go find it. Lancelot arrives, so 
        you all start your search for the white Soulgorger together.</span></p><br><br>
