<p><span style="background-color: #faf3ea;"><span lang="en">ALICE Fiction was a game produced by WonderPlanet. The game takes place in a virtual 
    world known as ALICE, where many avatars interact with others as well as with folklores, amalgamations of data about certain historical and 
    mythological figures that coalesced into a new form within ALICE and gained sentience. Most of ALICE is governed by the Queen, a highly 
    sophisticated security AI with self learning capabilities. <br><br>The game was shut down on September 30th, 2024, across all servers.</p>
