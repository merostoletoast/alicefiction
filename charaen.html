        <details close><summary id="np">Bond 2 &#9660;</summary>The son of a court musician, Amadeus was born in Salzburg in the Holy Roman Empire. His father noticed his son's genius quickly and soon started to instruct him in the art of music. At the age of three, Amadeus could play the harpsicord, and by the age of five he began creating musical pieces. He would tour Europe with his father as a musician, 
            seeking employment hor handsome rewards. According to Goethe, the child prodigy shared the level of talent Shakespeare had in literature and Raphael had in painting. Despite receiving such praise across many lands, for some reason Amadeus was unable to find work. 
            <br><br>At the age of six, he performed at Schönbrunn Palace before the inclumbent empress Maria Teresa. One famous story claims that he fell over, and when Princess Antonia offered him her hand, he took it and proposed.
            <br><br>As a young man, Amadeus moved to Vienna and started working as a freelance musician, gaining popularity as a pianist. In the yers before his death, his income decreased and consequently, his debts increased. At one point, a request for a requiem came from an unknown client, in exchange for hefty compensation. Alas, Amadeus's health deteriorated until he was left bedridden, and ultimately, without finishing the piece, passed away.<br><br></details>        
        <details close><summary id="np">Bond 3 &#9660;</summary>Amadeus was extremely wasteful and conducted himself rather badly, making it difficult for him to acquire well-paid work. In addition, there were rumors that head court musician Salieri feared Amadeus’s ability at a time when Italian musicians were in favor, and as a result stifled the young talent’s success. It seems Amadeus caught wind of this and blamed Salieri for being unable to enter the upper echelons of society in Vienna.

            <br><br>The problems with his personality and wastefulness no doubt led to his monetary strife and difficulties with getting work in his later years.

Alas, his plays and songs did not strike a chord with audiences, and ultimately his voice broke, leaving him frustrated. However, the stage proprietor favorited him, and Hans was able to switch his focus to philology and philosophy. He made use of his travels around Europe to self-publish a travelogue. Later, his story “Agnete and the Merman” was released to little fanfare, but a reworking titled “The Little Mermaid” would eventually become one of Andersen’s most famous works. His many friends at the time included Victor Hugo and both the Alexandre Dumases. 
            <br>While his fairy tales received little acclaim when he began, his persistence ultimately led to him becoming a revered writer later in life. Unfortunately, he was known to have a habit of going overboard when it came to love, and would send autobiographical pieces as love letters to those he fancied.

        <details close><summary id="np">Bond 3 &#9660;</summary>It's said that Andersen inherited his compulsive lying from his father’s mother.

One worry he could never shake was the feeling that, loke his father and grandfather, he would lose his mind before passing away.
            <br>Even within ALICE, Andersen still clings on to the anxieties that haunted her past; however, on the whole she is leading a joyful second life. Still, her incredible clumsiness often leads to mistakes, and her nerves tend to make her explanations and excuses so flowery they become like fairy tales.

Its members regard her as a bit of a problem, and have to keep her on close watch, but they look upon her with affection. Incidentally, Andersen finds Ms. Sato far scarier than pawns from the Waste Area.

When Archimedes got into the bath after receiving the request, he noticed the hot water overflowing, and realized that if he submerged the crown in water, a volume equal to that of the crown should be displaced.

He later became a member of the Landtag. However, he was still very conservative at that time and gave no need to any ideas about German 
            unification or political reform, going o far as to defend the monarchy during the March Revolution. The king then appointed him as the Prussian envoy to the Frankfurt Bundestag, ambassador to Russia, and ambassador to France. During this time, he learned more deeply of the situation in Europe, leading him to consider the need for Prussia to participate in a unified Germany.<br><br></details>        
        <details close><summary id="np">Bond 3 &#9660;</summary>King Wilhelm I of Prussia appointed Bismark prime minister of Prussia in 1862. When he and the king attempted to reform the government and expand the military, they were opposed by the Prussian House of Representatives. It was here that Bismark delivered his famous Iron and Blood speech, in which he stated, “Not through speeches and 
            majority decisions will the great questions of the day be decided, […] but by iron and blood”. Iron represented weapons, and blood meant the bloodshed of soldiers – Prussia would become a military power, regardless of the House of Representatives’ decisions. From this point on, Bismark became known as the Iron Chancellor. 
            <br><br>Victory in the Austro-Prussian War in 1866 eliminated Austrian power, and the victory in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71 brought Germany together under one flag, marking Bismark the first Chancellor of the German Empire. For the next 20 years, he controlled relations among European countries through his foreign policy, nicknamed Bismarckian diplomacy. First, he isolated France, which had been defeated in the Franco-Prussian War, suppressed its 
            reemergence, and balanced conflicts with other countries through complex secret military alliances. However, when Wilhelm I died in 1888, his successor, Wilhelm II, dismissed Bismark’s policies as passive. Bismark resigned in 1890 and later passed away on July 30th, 1898. He requested his tombstone be inscribed with the words, “A loyal German servant of Emperor Wilhelm I.
            <br><br>In ALICE, Bismark is friendly, humble, and hospitable. However, he also has a fondness for alcohol and ousters, and tends to lose himself whenever these two things are involved. He also will occasionally show a more hot-blooded side of himself, and may not hesitate to use forceful measures when riled up – perhaps the influence of the impassioned Iron and Blood speech. However, this is also a reflection of his political conviction to protest and better the lives of those with whom he is associated.<br><br></details>

        <details close><summary id="np">Bond 2 &#9660;</summary>Clan name Ji, courtesy name Da, Daji was a consort of the Shang Dynasty who lived around the 11th century BC. She corrupted the once-great King Zhou to the point that his subjects referred to him as a mindless ruler.
            <br><br>Rumors of her cruelty passed through generations-tales told of her laughter as she watched the punishments she'd cajoled the king into performing. The most famous of these tortures were the Bronze Toaster and the Snake Pit. In the first, a copper cylinder coated with oil was laid over burning coals, and the accused was forced to walk barefoot across it. In the second, tons of poisonous snakes and insects were placed in a hole, into which the accused was dropped.
            <br><br>False testimony from Daji forced the sitting empress out of her position. The empress' hands were burned with a copper pole in punishment, but she refused to yield. Though she continued to appeal to King Zhou for her innocence, she ultimately lost her life.
            <br><br>After that, Daji continued to use King Zhou's favor as a shield for all kinds of extravagance and evils. A phrase in Chinese that means lavish feasts, "pond of alcohol and forest of meat", comes from a legendary banquet of Daji's, which allegedly had ponds of pure alcohol, meat draped over trees, and naked men and women forced to chase each other.
            <br><br>In the end, she was killed by King Wu of Zhou, successor to King Wen, who had raised an army to take down the tyrannical king. Interestingly enough, in the "Fengshen Yanyi," she was captured by Nuwa and killed by Taigong Wang, not King Wu.<br><br></details>

            <br><br>Some novels and other works of fiction depict Daji's actions as not necessarily rooted in evil but rather a means to achieving an end. Still others do not even portray Daji as a fox or some other non-human creature.

It's said he was born in either 1466 or 1480, and he may have been one of the 16 who received a degree in divinity from Heidelberg University in 1509, but it's also possible this is a record of a different Faust.

While no document has definitively proven the existence of a historical Faust, it's likely the now legendary character was based on a man (or men) who once walked this earth.
            <br><br>Doctor Faust is believed to have died when one of his alchemical experiments failed, exploding and scattering what remained of his body. This is possibly the source of the legend in which Faust made a pact with a demon who stole his soul and scattered his remains when he died.

            until further advancements in medical equipment were made. Some of the writings served as a basis for modern medicine, but after the fall of the Roman Empire, many were lost. What remained made its way to the Islamic world and served as medical canon until the Renaissance.

However he kept his name and station a secret, so was made to work in the kithens at first. His secrecy aboyt his name along with his fair, delicate hands earned him the "Beaumains" (lit. "fair hands"). While some may see this as a compliment, to a knight it was an insult, because it indicated he was not suited to m=becoming a warrior.
            <br><br>A year later, a maiden came to the palace, begging for someone to help her sister - later revealed to be an esteemed dame. However, the woman could not give details of this alleged dame, and thus the crown was unable to send a proper knight; instead, the unnamed Gareth was sent. It was around that time that Sir Lancelot would at long last knight him Sir Gareth - once Gareth had defeated the knight who had captured the dame and his mother revealed his true identity, Gareth was welcomed as a Knight of the Round Table.<br><br></details>        
        <details close><summary id="np">Bond 3 &#9660;</summary>While his brothers engaged in assassination and surprise attack, legend says the forthright and kind-hearted Gareth never once joined in. Ratherr, he lamented his brothers' deeds.

            <br><br>Unfortunately, Lancelot became intimate with the king's wife, Queen Guinevere, and, once discovered, he murdered several knights and fleds. Despite the fact that some of his own relatives were slain in the incident, Gareth still respected his idol and had no desire to fight him - even when Lancelot reappeared in shame to save Queen Guinevere from being burned alive as punishment.

            <br><br>In ALICE, Gareth is well liked by those around her. Gawain, who knows about the many tragedies surrounding Gareth's death, adores her - a little too much, to the point of being overprotective. Conscious of the needs of those around her, Gareth often everextends herself just to help others; because of 
            this, she rarely goes outside unaccompained. Consequently, she is aware and a little embarrased about her comparative naivety toward worldly matters. There is a rumor going around that she is secretly very strong, her abilities smothered under the protectiviness of those around her. Even so, Gareth claims to be nowhere near as strong as her fellow Knights of the Round Table.<br><br></details>

            One of the knights of the Round Table of Arthurian legend.<br><br>Resolutely fearless, Gawain worked as King Arthur's right-hand man, with the sword Galatine at his side.<br><br></details>
        <details close><summary id="np">Bond 2 &#9660;</summary>A nephew of King Arthur, Gawain is famous for being an excellent warrior and one of the first members of the Knights of the Round Table. However, with so many different authors contributing their own interpretations to the legend of King Arthur, it is difficult to pin down his exact personality.
            <br><br>According to English literature, Gawain was the ultimate hero: brilliant and gallant, but with fatal flaws that were all too human. While many accounts paint Gawain as incredibly chivalrous and of upstanding character, French tellings speak of a different Gawain, more vengeful and stubborn - perhaps a direct result of Sir Lancelot's popularity in France.
            <br><br>In the earliest versions of the stiry, he is described as the son of King Lot, who ruled over the Orkney Islands to the north-east of the British Isles. King Lot's wife is the elder sister of King Arthur, making Gawain Arthur's nephew. 
            <br><br>At 12 years of age, he is said to have become a page to the Pope, which is what led to him becoming a knight, and from morning to noom, his power was said to be triple that of his normal ability. Legend has it that his beloved sword was etched with the name "Galatine", but no records state anything about how the knight came to own it or where it ended up.<br><br></details>        
        <details close><summary id="np">Bond 3 &#9660;</summary>Gawain's stubbornness and vengefulness began with his fallout with Sir Lancelot, another knight of the Round Table. 
            <br><br>is sons Gingalain, Lovell, and Florence, and his brother Agravain were killed when they tried to interfere with Lancelot and Guinevere's relationship. At this time, Gawain was more concerned about his duty to King Arthur than his own personal ills. However, when Guinevere was to be executed for adultery, Lancelot came to her rescue, killing Gawain's brothers Gaheris and Gareth in the process and leaving the knight with very few relatives left; only then did Gawain at last vow revenge. After that, King Arthur tried to make peace with Lancelot, but Gawain fought hard against it.
            <br><br>Gawain is said to have died during a battle caused by his half-brother Mordred's rebellion. The "Historia Regum Britanniae" ("The History of Kings of Britania")  doesn't detail who fought who, but "Le Morte d'Arthur"
            <br><br>("The Death of Arthur") states that Gawain was injured by Lancelot and then mortally wounded during Mordred's rebellion. As he is dying, he laments that it was his stubbornness that caused the rebellion, and writes a letter to Lancelot begging his forgiveness and requesting aid for him.
            <br><br>In ALICE, Gawain is overprotective to a fault, and tends to smother her siblings. However, as a former knight, she is very diligent and just, proving that the English version of her story defines her character. No one knows whether she is still three times stronger when the sun is high in the sky, but eben so, she is still able to send an enemy flying regardless of the time of day.</details>

        <details close><summary id="np">Bond 2 &#9660;</summary>Born in 1405 to the prestigious Laval family at their castle in Champtocé-sur-Loire, many say Gilles de Rais grew up excelling in both the arts and the blade. He lost his parents at a young age, and he and his younger brother were raised under the care of their grandfather.
            <br><br>Gilles de Rais's grandfather adored and coddled him, to the point of separating the boy from the private tutors his father had employed for him. However, his grandfather had ulterior motives as well. Once, he attempted to steal the land of a neighboring lordship by kidnapping the young heiress and forcing her to marry Gilles. This early experience may have twisted Gilles's personality forever.
            <br><br>Gilles de Rais grew to be a knight, and joined the royal court in 1424. At the time, France and England were in the midst of the Hundred Years' War. Gilles was a military commander during this war, and he soon rose to prominence with his courageous feats.

            Johann Wolfgang von Goethe was an influential German writer who was active during the late 18th and early 19th centuries. He authored many well-known works, such as "Faust" and "the Sorrows of Young Werther". Aside from his literary pursuits, Goethe was a naturalist and a politician.<br><br></details>
        <details close><summary id="np">Bond 2 &#9660;</summary>Goethe was born to a wealthy family in Frankfurt, Germany in 1749. His father provided him with a good education in his younger years, and at the age of 16, Goethe began studying law at Leipzig University. When he was 19, however, he became severely ill and returned home to recuperate. During this time of recovering his health, it's believed Goethe found an interest in the natural sciences and started conducting his own research with newly-purchased scientific equipment.
            <br><br>After a year and a half of recovery, he enrolled in the University of Strasbourg in France and resumed his study of law. Goethe returned home the following year, but since there were no positions available in the office his father suggested for him, Goethe 
            decided to open his own legal practice. At the same time, however, since his true passion was literature, he began writing his first drama. Worried at this lack of focus, his father sent him to study law once again, this time at the supreme court in Wetzlar. This had the opposite effect, however, and the distance from his father only increased Goethe's literary pursuits.
            <br><br>In Wetzlar, Goethe fell in love with a woman named Charlotte. His feelings ended in heartbreak, though, since she was already engaged to another man. Thisevent, along with his friend's suicide at this time, later inspired his novel "The Sorrows of Young Werther".
            <br><br>Goethe eventually returned to Frankfurt to practice law. Although law was his official profession, he also took time to edit and self-publish "Götz von Berlichingen", a drama he had written previously. The drama was a huge success, and in September 1774, "The Sorrows of Young Werther" was also published. The novel was wildly popular among the younger generation. It became fashionable to speak and dress like the protagonist, Werther, and the craze even sparked a sudden rise in suicides. This was also when Goethe began writing "Faust".<br><br></details>        
        <details close><summary id="np">Bond 3 &#9660;</summary>In 1775, Goethe's old friend Duke Karl August invited him to his court at Weimar. August acted as an older brother to Goethe and also granted him a position in the government, which resulted in Goethe staying in Weimar. Another deciding factor in this move may have been a romantic relationship he had at the time. Six years later, Goethe was made a nobleman and became Weimar's de facto prime minister.
            <br><br>In 1786, he took a prolonged leave of absence from the court and his duties to make a long-awaited trip to Italy, during which he resumed his literary career. A few years later, Goethe returned to Weimar and was blessed with the birth of his eldest son, August. This period also marked the beginning of the French Revolution. Although Goethe is said to have agreed with the spirit of the revolution, he disliked the resulting lack of government.
            <br><br>In 1806,Napoleon invaded Weimar. Though soldiers occupied his home, Goethe completed the first part of "Faust" that year. Napoleon was a fan of "The Sorrows of Young Werther" and later summoned Goethe to meet. Napoleon was so impressed that it's said he exclaimed "Vous êtes un homme!" ("You are a man!") during their meeting.
            <br><br>Though unwell in his final years, Goethe put his whole heart into completing "Faust". He died not long after finishing the second part. It's said Goethe's last words were "Mehr Licht!" ("More light!")
            <br><br>In ALICE, Goethe has gained a deep appreciation for hip hop. She feels that rap is the modern version of poetry, and has begun a career as an underground rap artist. The videos she's uploaded have a lot of views, and her fans are steadily increasing.<br><br></details>

His journey began where modern-day France is located and continued over the treacherous and snow-ridden mountain range to Rome. Given the journey's notoriously hazardous conditions, it's no wonder the Roman senate were taken by surprise. 
            After consolidating his hold of Northern Italy, Hannibal set about cutting off cities affiliated with Rome, while advancing south. While some consuls were able to avoid a direct confrontation with the general, those who chose to fight were ultimately defeated. Consequently, having lost so many consuls, Rome gradually began to lose its will to fight back. Still, despite Hannibal's sturdy 
            offense, reinforcements were lacking, forcing him to drastically slow down his advance. The loss of his younger brothers combined with failed allegiances resulted in him losing the upper hand in Southern Italy. Ultimately, Hannibal was undone by the consul Scipio, who ignored the general in favor of attacking the Carthage mainland directly from Africa.<br><br></details>

            consul Scipio said he couldn't be trusted, given that their previous non-aggression pact had failed when Hannibal attacked Saguntum, a Roman ally. After negotiations fell apart, war resumed once again. In the end, Scipio emerged victorious, making use of his light-armored troops to render Hannibal's battle elephants ineffective.

Zeus's wife, Hera, however, was jealous and delayed the birth of the twins with the help of the goddess of childbirth, allowing another descendant of Perseus tp be born first. This child was Eurystheus, a future Mycenaean king.

            <br><br>Under his theory, the human body contains four "humors," or fluids: blood, phlegm, yellow bile, and black bile, and an imbalance in any of these fluids is what causes illnesses. Promoting the importance of rest, Hippocrates centered his treatment around drawing out the natural healing capabilities of human body.
            <br><br>Additionaly, Hippocrates is credited with helping to prevent the spread of infectious diseases when he discovered the plague was caused by an unhygienic environment rather than by a hit from an arrow of the gods.<br><br></details>        
        <details close><summary id="np">Bond 3 &#9660;</summary>The medical theories posited by Hippocrates were srill rooted in ancient beliefs; imbalance in the bodyli fluids was the cause of illness, meaning the entire body required treatment.
            <br>Though in many ways considered inaccurate by modern standarts, much of the medical knowledge Hippocrates gathered would serve as the foundation for medicine after his death, are around the 3rd century BC it would be collected in the Hippocratic Corpus.
            <br>Hippocrates did not author the bulk is still attributed to Hippocrates himself. Among the writings is the Hippocratic Oath, which was adopted and revised in 1948 by World Medical Association as the Declaration of Geneva. It served as a pkedge by all medical professionals to always prioritize the well-being and confidentiality of patiens. The pledge is still taken by doctors to this very day.
            <br>Hippocrates was not only an accomplished doctor, but also an instructor, passing on his teaching in Thessaly, Thrace, and near the Sea of Marmara, among other places, and it's believed the city of Larissa in Thessaly was his final resting place. 
            <br>Some ssay he was 90 years old when he died, others maintain he was 194, but his exact age at death remains unknown.
            <br><br>In ALICE, Hippocrates is in charge of the medical ward at the Discarded Data Institute, where she single-handedly looks after the well-being of all those who are affiliated with the institute. Hippocrates is a skilled medical professional,but she is only intrigued by the wounded or the sick, or medical anomalies. Once a patient is healthy again, she loses interest in them.<br><br></details>

            Jack the Ripper was the nickname given to an unidentifield serial killer who committed a series of murders targeting prostitutes in and around Whitechapel in london, England.<br><br></details>
        <details close><summary id="np">Bond 2 &#9660;</summary>The first crime is thought to have occurred on August 31st, 1888, when a prostitute named Mary Ann Nichols was found dead on Buck's Row in Whitechapel-at least five such murders are attributed to Jack the Ripper. The targets were all prostitutes living in poverty, and they had all been cut in the same spot. As some victims had organs removed, it was thought the perpetrator had specialized medical knowledge.
            <br><br>On September 29th of the same year, the police received a letter from a person claiming to be Jack the Ripper confessing and announcing other attacks. Numerous similar letters arrived, most of them pranks.
            <br><br>However, the next letter from Jack that arrived is considered genuine as it contained the details of the following incident. If genuine, it would make Jack the Ripper a theatrical criminal.
            <br><br>The Jack the Ripper case was covered extensively in the media and threw Londoners into confusion. Ironically, it drew attention to the poor living conditions and poverty of the East End, and about twenty years after the incident, the slums were cleared.<br><br></details>

            The canonical five and the other six murders discovered around the same time were collectively referred to as the Whitechapel murders. However, debate continues as to whether or not Jack was responsible for the other murders outside the canonical five.
            <br><br>There were several murders outside of the Whitechapel area that some suspect of being Jack's work, but some of these cases are not even confirmed to have actually taken place. The curious cases of brutal murders are still talked about like an urban legend.
            <br><br>Her true identity is still unknown to this day, Jack the Ripper appears in ALICE as a composite of legends, rumors, and speculation. Her vulgar tone seems to be the result of internalizing the information that the victims were all prostitutes.
            <br><br>She sometimes has uncontrollable urges toward women but tries to divert those urges to herself. Rumor has it that she has been cooperating in investigations of violent crimes to keep herself disciplined, but she denies all claims.<br><br></details>

An assistant Al is a partner system that a user can activate by voice command or other means to help with various tasks. These assistants can perform a wide range of tasks such as sending emails, placing online orders, turning appliances on or off, playing music, and even navigation. Additionally, these Als can use interaction data to learn their users' preferences and habits, making them excel as conversation partners. An assistant Al with its user is not unlike a servant with a master, and this commonly-held impression may have had an influence on LEX's appearance and behavior.
            <br><br>As a Folklore, LEX is an obedient, honest, and overly-serious person who lives to fulfill his master's wishes. However, his pride and unwavering confidence in his abilities can prevent him from admitting when he mishears or misunderstands a command; instead, he remains stoic in front of others even when making a mistake.
            <br><br>Some interpret this as insincerity, but in truth, he takes criticism very seriously. He is generally very competent, though, and takes great pleasure in serving his master. If given precise instructions, he can carry them out perfectly.<br><br></details>

            Longinus was a Roman soldier in the time of Christ. It is said that when Christ was crucified on the hill of Golgotha, Longinus stabbed his spear into Christ's left side to confirm whether he was alive or dead. The blood entered his blind eye and restored his sight.
            <br><br></details>
        <details close><summary id="np">Bond 2 &#9660;</summary>In stories about Longinus, he was said to be a centurion who led a unit of about 100 people. During Christ's crucifixion on Golgotha, Longinus stabbed him in the side with a spear to confirm his death. The blood of Christ spilled upon his blinded eye, restoring his eyesight. This miracle caused him to convert and become baptized.
            <br><br>His spear came to be known as the "Lance of Longinus" or "Holy Lance" and is considered a sacred relic for having touched the blood of Christ. Several artifacts are claimed to be the Lance of Longinus; one such item is kept in St. Peter's Basilica, another in Vienna was supposedly kept by the Holy Roman Emperor, and yet another went missing after allegedly being found during the First Crusade. Of these, the one from the Holy Roman Empire was found via modern science to date from around the 8th or early 9th century, too new to be the genuine Lance of Longinus.<br><br></details>        
        <details close><summary id="np">Bond 3 &#9660;</summary>Nothing is known about this Roman soldier after his sight was restored by the blood of Christ, except that he was baptized. The official feast day of Saint Longinus used to be March 15th, which was inspired by the feast of the blind Norse god Hod. Like Longinus, Hod had made a grave mistake due to his blindness, tricked by the evil god Loki into shooting and killing his own brother Baldr.
            <br><br>The name Longinus is not found in the New Testament but in the apocryphal Gospel of Nicodemus, also known as the Acts of Pilate. In fact, the very existence of Longinus was not mentioned until much later, and it is not certain if anyone had pierced Jesus with a spear.
            <br><br>In ALICE, Longinus covers her eyes with a blindfold, despite having regained her eyesight. The fear left from piercing the Son of God keeps her from removing the blindfold, and she is terrified to look at the world around her or glimpse her own eyes in the mirror. Living blindfolded doesn't seem to perturb her, however, as she spends most of her time praying quietly.<br><br></details>

            MacGregor Mathers was a 19th century British occultist and one of the founders of the Hermetis Order of the Golden Dawn. He translated many occult works and has had an influence on the modern esoteric world.<br><br></details>
        <details close><summary id="np">Bond 2 &#9660;</summary>Though born Samuel Liddell Mathers, he added "MacGregor" to his name in order to claim heritage to the Scottish Highlands. It's said that he even went as far as to call himself the Count of Glenstrae after the MacGregor who had received that title.
            <br><br>In his twenties, Mathers joined the Freemasons and rose to the high rank of Master Mason in just ten years. This allowed him to become a member of the Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia, which only accepts those of Master Mason rank.
            <br><br>At the request of his friend and fellow member Westcott, Mathers successfully decoded the Cipher Manuscripts. Thus began Mathers's acquaintance with Westcott and Anna Sprengel, a German occultist mentioned in the decoded manuscripts. A member of a Rosicrucian society in Germany, Sprengel gave them permission to establish a temple.
            <br><br>Westcott and Mathers, along with a man named Woodman, then went ahead and founded the Isis-Urania Temple in London. This marked the beginning of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn.
            <br><br>Using his knowledge of English, French, Latin, and other languages, Mathers translated and edited famous occult works such as the "Key of Solomon" and the "Grimoire of Armadel" using copies he found in libraries and museums in London and Paris. These works have greatly influenced the occult world over the years.<br><br></details>        
        <details close><summary id="np">Bond 3 &#9660;</summary>In 1890, the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn had more than 100 members from all walks of life. Around 1897, however, conflict arose within the organization when Westcott, one of its leaders, resigned suddenly. Fellow founder Woodman had also died by this time, leaving Mathers as the society's sole head.
            <br><br>History tells us that Mathers, living in Paris at the time, was often absent from meetings and involved in disputes with other members. Those in London grew discontent with his leadership. To make matters worse, in 1899, Mathers initiated Aleister Crowley into the order after the temple in London refused Crowley's admission. This infuriated members in London, and they called for his removal from the order.
            <br><br>In retaliation, Mathers tried to seize ceremonial objects from the Golden Dawn and interfere in the operations of the organization. He ultimately failed, however, when the police became involved. This resulted in a split within the Golden Order and the foundation of Alpha et Omega. Mathers' wife, Moina Mathers, took over the newly formed order following his death to influenza in 1918.
            <br><br>In ALICE, Mathers is an impressive magic user and specializes in divination. Although she sometimes reverts to old habits and assumes the superior air of a great leader, she often apologizes after remembering her past failure in that role.

            Merlin was a legendary wizard of Britannia and a close confidant of King Arthur. He played an active role in guiding Arthur to the Lade of the Lake, from whom he received Excalibur. His astute advice also led the king to victory in battles against rebel forces.<br><br></details>

            <br><br>While Merlin's legends with King Arthur are his most famous, one of his earliest tales is being summoned by the king, the tyrant Vortigern, as a human sacrifice for the new royal tower. However, the young Merlin predicted that there was a lake underneath the tower, upon which there were two stones, with two dragons sleeping atop them. When this was found to be true, he was spared from being sacrificed. Merlin then foresaw that Vortigern's brother, Aurelian, would slay his tyrant brother king. Prophecy became truth, and Aurelian won, making him the new King of Britain.
            <br><br>Now king Aurelian sought out Merlin, who had been hiding himself in the woods, to consult him about creating a victory monument. It's said that Merlin used mmagc to carry over enotmous stones-thus creating Stonehenge. 
            <br><br>There are other theories about the relationship between Stonehenge and Merlin. One tells of Merlin advising to use an enormouse stone circle called Giant's Dance in Mount Killaraus in Ireland, and the king's brother Uther set out on an expedition to bring it back. Uther built a megalithic complex in Aesbury and commanded it for the rest of his life, and was burried there after his death. Some claim this structure to be Stonehenge, but that is chronologically improbable.<br><br></details>

As Merlin had foreseen, Arthur became king, and Merlin began to serve at his side. Merlin of the later led Arthur to the Lady of the Lake and helpe him obtain the holy sword Excalibur.
            <br><br>When Arthur married Queen Guinevere, Merlin prophesized that this marriage would end in misfortune. Soon after, Merlin gradually ceases to appear in the legends. In the end, Viviane, fed up with his advances on her, seals him deep into the ground, and his story ends. 
            <br><br>Merlin remains a famous sorcerer worldwire and is often depicted as a character or symbol today. However, because of his incubus origins and the episode with Viviane, he is sometime portrayed as a womanizer. These traits carry over to ALICE, where Merlin aggressively approaches women wherever she goes. Viviane still seems to be impervious to these charms, though.<br><br></details>

            Michelangelo di Lodovico Buonarroti simoni, an artist active during the Renaissance. Although he was a sculptor by profession, his talents extended to many other fields, including painting and architecture.<br><br></details>
        <details close><summary id="np">Bond 2 &#9660;</summary>Michelangelo was born March 6, 1475, in Caprese, Florentine Republic. As a child, he lived with a family of stonemasons, which he said was where he learned to handle a hammer and a chisel to carve figures. Michelangelo's father wanted him to study, but Michelangelo was not interested in academics, preferring to copy decorative church paintings and socialize with painters. Then, at the age of thirteen, he became an apprentice to the painter Domenico Ghirlandaio, and at fourteen, he already exhibited the skill to be recognized as a full-fledged artist.
            <br><br>In 1489, the Medici family, well-known patrons of many artists, asked Ghirlandaio to send two of his most distinguished pupils; Michelangelo was one of them. Michelangelo attended the Medici-founded humanist Platonic Academy, where he studied sculpture and interacted with leading humanists and poets.
            <br><br>History states that while under the care of a branch family of the Medicis, "he was ordered to forge a sculpture to look as if it had been excavated. The cardinal it was sent to quickly recognized it as a forgery. However, the craftsmanship of the piece itself caught the cardinal's interest, and Michelangelo was invited to Rome. It was during this time that one his masterpieces, Pieta, was commissioned by the French ambassador in Rome.
            <br><br>In 1504, Michelangelo carved the David, which is not only his most famous sculpture, but also one of the most well-known works in the istory of art. After that, he found himself busy with the production of mausoleums ordered by Pope Julius II, among other commissions from, succeeding popes. The Sistine Chapel ceiling painting in particular was a major work that took four years to complete. In 1564, Michelangelo passed away at 88 before completing renovations of the Vatican's St. Peter's Basilica. In accordance with his will, he was buried in the Basilica of Santa Croce in Florence.<br><br></details>        
        <details close><summary id="np">Bond 3 &#9660;</summary>The odd "B" attached to Michelangelo's name indicates a subspecies. This is not a subspecies of the great Michelangelo but rather a variant of a computer virus of the same name. Since it activates every year on March 6th, Michelangelo's birthday, it was named after him. The viral outbreak began in 1992 yet its source remains unknown; theorists mark its origins in Swedwn, Denmark, the Netherlands, or similar places.
            <br><br>Michelangelo is a so-called system-domain-infected virus. When it enters a system, it overwrites all data on the hard disk with a string of nonsensical characters, making it impossible to retrieve information. For some reason, however, the virus only infects computers that are booted up om March 6th; because of this, some specialists have taken to adjusting computer dates one day ahead to bypass the virus. 
            <br><br>In ALICE, Michelangelo is an anomalous mixture of the virus and the public's ideas of the famed artist. This makes him different from the original Michelangelo virus, and he is considered a "B" variant. Indeed, if Michelangelo-B were a pupe virus and did not carry any Folklore qualities, the Queen would not allow him to exist in ALICE at all. As the only Folklore to be derived from a virus, Michelangelo often hides this fact and poses as a meek, shy little boy, much like original painter who shares his name. However, his true nature is that of a mischief-maker, eagerly waiting to play out his role as a virus<br><br></details>

One legend claims that at the age of 21, while at the imperial capital, he fought members of the Yoshioka clan, who were unable to defeat him, leaving several dead.The clan's disciples, numbering in the hundreds, donned armor and attacked him, but Musashi took them all on single-handedly and emerged the victor after ordering his own students to stand back and watch. By the age of 29, he had over 60 fights under in all of them.
            <br><br>Some say the battle at Ganryuu-jima took place in 1612, though some writings suggest it was actually one or two years after the Battle of Sekigagara in 1600.

            Nietzsche was a philisopher from the Kingdom of Prussia. While working as a university professor in Switzerland, he renounced his nationality from Prussia and became stateless. The well-known phrase "God is dead" comes from his novel "Thus Spoke Zarathustra".<br><br></details>
        <details close><summary id="np">Bond 2 &#9660;</summary>Born in a small village near Leipzig in the Kingdom of Prussia, Nietzsche was the son of a pastor. He lost his father and younger brother in succession when he was a child, and, with some relatives' help, supported his family together with his mother and younger sister Elisabeth. Elisabeth grew up with an intensely strong admiration for her brother, so much so that there's a story of how when Nietzsche had grown and found his first love, she became jealous and intruded into the relationship, ruining it.
            <br><br>Around this time, friction in the family and periodic medical seizures were said to have led Nietzsche to become obsessed with suicidal thoughts. He visited Italy to free himself from it all, and it was here that he wrote the first part of his masterpiece "Thus Spoke Zarathustra" in just ten days. He went on to write books on his thoughts, such as "Beyond Good and Evil" and "The Birth of Tragedy". By the time his book sales had seen a gradual increase, Nietzsche's interest had turned to philosophy.
            <br><br>To his displeasure, his sister Elisabeth married an anti-Semite, putting a strain on their relationship and limiting their contact to letters. They did not see each other again until Nietzsche's illness had taken over.
            <br><br>Despite stating in his will that only a few of his closest friends were to be invited to his funeral, the ceremony was largely attended by intellectuals and military personnel-Elisabeth forbade Nietzsche's friends from attending.<br><br></details>        
        <details close><summary id="np">Bond 3 &#9660;</summary>The concept "God is dead" gained fame in Nietzsche's "Thus Spoke Zarathustra", which consists of four parts. His character Zarathustra narrates his representative ideas of eternal return and the superhuman.
            <br><br>Eternal return is the idea that the essences of all values and objects are not absolute but mutable; that good and evil, superior and inferior, are merely human assumptions-that everything in existence is, in fact, cyclical and will occur again. Meanwhile, the superhuman is defined as a person who transcends negative emotions, faces and accepts all the changing of values, and breaks free from those mutable values to affirm their own existence. Both of these ideas reject the long-held Western religious notion of channeling a lifetime of suffering into one's life after death, and instead seek to overcome and survive the current cycle of suffering.
            <br><br>Nietzsche lived in a time when societal values were in flux due to breakthrough theories such as the theory of evolution. At the time, Nietzsche's philosophy of how to live better with a firm sense of one's own values and ethics, without being swayed by external factors, was such a new idea that the later philosopher Sartre dubbed him the "pioneer of existentialism".
            <br><br>In ALICE, Nietzsche continues to urge today's troubled citizens to be superhuman, but it's unknown whether she plans to become a superhuman herself.

As a child, she received a high-quality education, studying not only multiple languages, but also mathematics, astronomy, economics, etc. People say she was stubborn and had a strong sense of self, preferring to lose herself in academia rather than learn more feminine things like manners and embroidery from her mother. While doing charity work one year, Nightingale was moved by the plight of poor farmers and factory workers, and thus decided to pursue a career aiding others.
            <br><br>Stories about her say that when Nightingale announced to her family that she intended to become a nurse, she was met with resistance, as at the time, such a profession was looked down upon. It was a profession not needing any expertise, and typically reserved for older women who could no longer work as prostitutes or women who had lost their jobs.

She was dispatched to a field hospital, where she tirelessly treated the injured regardless of the side on which they fought. To ensure those above her recognized the importance of maintaining proper hygiene in field hospitals, she meticulously recorded every death and created visualizations to make the data easily understandable. Queen Victoria then saw to it that Nightingale's reports came to her directly, and that field hospital conditions were improved.
            <br><br>Despite devoting much of her time to improving hospitals, Nightingale did not falter in her duties to her patients. For example, she would often walk around at night with a lamp in her hand to see if any patients needed assistance.

            A hero in Greek mythology. As a demigod carrying the blood oh Zeus in him, Perseus used his might to slay the Gorgon Medusa. He was cast into the sea in a wooden chest as a child which is said to be the reason he suffered from nyctophobia (fear of the dark).<br><br></details>
        <details close><summary id="np">Bond 2 &#9660;</summary>Perseus is best known in stories for his defeat of Medusa, but his quest to do so was only because the lord of Serifos who fell in love with his mother, Danae, wanted to rid himself of the young man.

Perseus saved Andromeda from her cruel fate, and brought her home with him.
            <br><br>Once home, Perseus used the head of Medusa to turn the lord attacking his mother to stone. It is actually because of Perseus's turning people to stone that many claim Serifos is the rocky region it is now.<br><br></details>

            A sculptor from Greek mythology, who was the king of Cyprus. He carved the ideal woman and fell in love with her, eventually asking the Goddess Aphrodite to make her real.<br><br></details>
        <details close><summary id="np">Bond 2 &#9660;</summary>While it is generally accepted Pygmalion was King of Cyprus, some believe he was simply a sculptor. An unsophisticated man, he would find fault in all living women.

His various bold endeavors, such as constructing the Great Wall, unifying the currency, and shifting to a bureacratic system of counties and prefectures, had an enormous impact on generations thereafter. <br><br></details>
        <details close><summary id="np">Bond 2 &#9660;</summary>Many records say that Qin Shi Huang was born Ying Zheng on February 18, 259 BC. His father was a prince of Qin, but political hostage in Zhao with many other siblings in better positions, so there was almost no chance that he would inherit Qin. However, the rich merchant Lu Buwei took notice of him, gave him one of his concubines, and invested a hefty sum in enchacing his reputation. The child born to this concubine was named Zheng, who would grow to be the first emperor of a unified China.
            <br><br>In 258 BC, Qin attacked Zhao, ignoring its political hastages. Zheng's father managed to escape, leaving the boy behind with his mother. From then on he lived life on constant alert, fearing he would be killed if found; this tense period is said to have profoundly affected his personality. It was only after his father had made it back to Qin and became the crown prince through Lu Buwei's manipulations, that Zheng was able to go to Qin.
            <br><br>In 251 BC, the then-king of Qin passed away, and his son, Lord Anguo, ascended to the throne only to die as well after three days. Soon after, Zheng's father ascended the throne as Kind Zhuanxiang, but his reign only lasted three years before he, too, passed. This left Zheng to become king of Qin at the age of thirteen. Still young, Zheng left politics in the hands of Lu Buwei and others around him. Lu Buwei came to hold tremendous power.
            <br><br>In 238 BC, it was discovered that Lu Buwei had sent a fake eunuch to the queen dowager in order to break off his relationship with her. Zheng had her and two children executed, and sent a letter to Lu Buwei informing him of his exile. Realizing that he would lose his life eventually, Lu Buwei killed himself with poison. It is said that Zheng also punished any who dared to weep at his funeral.<br><br></details>        
        <details close><summary id="np">Bond 3 &#9660;</summary>By 238 BC, Zheng had fully come into power, declaring that he would destroy the lords, become emperorm and unify "all under heaven". In 236 DC, the war against Zhao began. During the eight-year conflict, Qin also invaded Han and destroyed it. When he finally brought down Zhao, he buried alive those who had fought against his mother's family.
            <br><br>With the fall of Zhao, the small country Yan grew concerned about Qin right on its borders, and plotted to assassinate Zheng. Zheng, however, found and murdered the assassins, then furiously launched an all-out attack on Yan. His soldiers slaughtered not only the families of the assassins but all the people living in the same villages as them.
            <br><br>In 225 BC, Zheng invaded Wei, folloed by Chu and Yan, destroying them one after the other. Finally, with the capture of Qi in 221 BC, Zheng created a unified China, "after which he changed his title from "king" to "emperor" and became the first emperor in Chinese history.
            <br><br>Following the unification of China, governance was shifted to a county and prefecture system, in which bureaucrats dispatched from the central government governed local areas. Zheng also undertook numerous reforms, including the standartization of currency and units of measurement, the construction of roads, and other major ptojects. Some of these projects, such as the Great Wall of China and Mausoleum of the First Qin Emperor, which housed rows upon rows of life-size terracotta warriors and horses, are now considered world heritage sites. On the other hand, the new emperor suppressed Confucian scholars and shamans who opposed him and burned books and buried scholars to restrict the written word, earning him a reputation as a tyrant.
            <br><br>In ALICE, the reborn Qin Shi Huang seems to be enjoying his second life, freed from the burden of being an emperor. However, much of his past royal demeanor remains in that he is very condescending and self-serving. In addition, he sometimes comments with perplexing statements, making him a difficult person to deal with. Yet these are in fact the words of a good policymaker with a future-oriented perspective--when people finally grasp what he is getting at, they tend to step away, either in fear or respect. This alienates him, though, and he longs for a friend with whom he can speak with as an equal, even if they do not share his views.<br><br></details>

            Jean-Jacques Rousseau was an influential author and philosopher who discussed political, social, and human ideals in works such as "The Social Contract" and "Emile, or On Education". He advocated against corruption in society, and his ideas later played a role in the French Revolution. <br><br></details>
        <details close><summary id="np">Bond 2 &#9660;</summary>Born in Geneva in 1712, Rousseau was essentially orphaned around the age of 10 when his father ran into trouble with the law and fled home without him. Though Rousseau gained work as an apprentice, he was abused there and eventually ran away. Around the age of 15, he came under the care of the Baroness de Warens. However, after noticing how dependent Rousseau was on her and how wayward he was with his studies, she too left him.
            <br><br>Once again without a home, Rousseau began to study to become a music instructor while he searched for Madame de Warens. When the two were at last reunited, they began their life together again as lovers. After a few years, however, de Warens brought home a new lover. Rousseau was unable to come to terms with this and left their home.
            <br><br>It is said that he moved to Paris to make a living as a private music instructor, among other things. Around this time, Rousseau married and he fathered five children, all of whom were unfortunately sent to orphanages due to the couple's poverty. In the midst of these hardships, Rousseau wrote the "Discourse on the Arts and Sciences", which was selected as the winning piece to be published in the Mercure de France. This great achievement put Rousseau in the spotlight, and he went on to author works that are praised for being the foundations of the democratic ideas of freedom and equality. His fame, however, had consequences: Rousseau was shunned and impoverished in his later years.
            <br><br>His words greatly influenced later generations, including the French "Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen", which states, "Men are born and remain free and equal in rights". His ideas were fundamental to the French Revolution, and he has been interred as a hero within the Panthéon.<br><br></details>        
        <details close><summary id="np">Bond 3 &#9660;</summary>Rousseau's philosophy has had a great influence on many later generations, but he was full of flaws, and his private life was far from praiseworthy.
            <br><br>Though he attended many different schools, both theological and otherwise, Rousseau failed to complete his studies at any of them. Similarly, he was unable to hold down a job for very long and tended to lean on others for financial assistance, including Madame de Warens.
            <br><br>Rousseau is also said to have been a masochist who made a habit of indecently exposing himself, and was once arrested for doing so to a woman on the street.
            <br><br>It is also Rousseau, and not Marie Antoinette, who first used the now-famous phrase, "Let them eat cake". In "Confessions", Rousseau attributes this phrase to "a great princess"-however, Marie Antoinette was only nine years old at the time and had not yet married into French aristocracy. The phrase has been widely, and falsely, attributed to her after the fact.
            <br><br>In ALICE, Rousseau is employed at the library. Though at first glance she appears to have turned over a new leaf, her speech tends to be peppered with unfortunate double entendres.

            Thor is the god of war in Norse mythology. He was a god of thunder and agriculture. Thor's worshippers became more widespread than those of Odin, the main god venerared in the ancient Germanic region. Many old texts tell tales of Thor's valiant heroism.<br><br></details>
        <details close><summary id="np">Bond 2 &#9660;</summary>Although the rise of the warrior class eventually forced Thor to relinquish his position as the supreme god of Norse mythology to Odin, his popularity and influence has shown no sign of waning. Even today, male names such as "Thor", "Torsten", and "Dustin" as well as the English word "Thursday" are all derived from the Norse god. 
            <br><br>His arms are said to be stronher than all the gods af Asgard combined, he is also famous for using the Dwarven hammer "Mjolnir" as his weapon of choice. He is said to be bold and violent in character, and while brave he is also said to be a bit simple-minded and easily angered. In fact, many have endured terrible suffering due to his anger outbursts. However, such an unusual disposition may be one of the reasons for Thor's popularuty. 
            <br><br>Thor has many dinamic and heroic episodes, including his battle with the giant serpent Jormungandr, so huge that it encircled the entire human world. 
            <br><br>In the final war between the gods and the Ragnarok giants, he was mortally wounded by Jormungandr, and the poison he received caused him to retreat 9 steps before he met his demise.<br><br></details>        
        <details close><summary id="np">Bond 3 &#9660;</summary>The Foklore embodiment of Thor retains memories of fighting at Ragnarok, so she id taking it easy now thinking that ALICE is the new world that comes after the turbulent and raging Ragnarok. However, the time of worshiping Nordic gods is now far in the past, and society is much more interested in science and capital in this modern day. Thor is still young for a Folklore, and maintains the simle-mindedness and roughness of myth. Upon appearing in this modern world, she did not feel at ease and soon came to live with Enkidu, who inhabits the lands far removed from humanity. They had quite a bit of trouble at the beginning of their stay together, but now they have come to be very close friends.<br><br></details>

            Vice-commander of the Shinsengumi as well as assistaint army commissioner for the Ezo Island government. He was a retainer for the Tokugawa shogunate during its final years, protecting the land from political unrest, and suppressing the Sonno Joi. During the Boshin War after the fall of the shogunate, he directed the former shogunate army.<br><br></details>
        <details close><summary id="np">Bond 2 &#9660;</summary>Born in 1835, Toshizo was the youngest child of a farmer in Ishida Village, Tama District, Musashi Province. Both his parents died of tuberculosis when he was young, leading him to be raised by his second eldest brother's wife.
            <br><br>Toshizo started out by selling his family's traditional medicine, while also working his way around various dojos to learn swordsmanship. His sister's husband supported the School of Tennen Rishin, which resulted in Toshizo meeting Isami Kondo and becoming a student.
            <br><br>In 1863, alongside Isami Kondo, he applied to join a group of expert warriors who protected the 14th shogun Iemochi Tokugawa. After reaching the capital, anti-shogunate groups appeared who resented foreigners, resulting in some members returning to Edo, and others remaining in Kyoto to protect the shogunate. Toshizo and Isami decided to stay and formed the "Miburoshigumi", a precursor to the Shinsengumi. 
            <br><br>They were tasked with guarding the city and directing Kyoto's now masterless samurai.
            <br><br>When the group was formed, the leaders were Kamo Serizawa, Nishiki Niimi, and Isami Kondo. However, Nishiki, confidant to Kamo Serizawa, would go around forcing store owners to lend him money that he would then spend on his own leisure, much to the annoyance of the Mito Domain. While the date of the event is unknown, it is believed Nishikis's poor conduct lead to him being forced to commit seppuku.
            <br><br>After the Miburashigumi were officially appointed as the Shinsengumi, Kamo Serizawa lost his temper at Yamatoya, a cloth store that had refused to lend his group money, and in a rage burned the place down. This infuriated the Kyoto protection group, and Isami ordered his execution. Toshizo, along with Okita and some others, perfomed the assassination, leaving Isami Kondo as the only leader of the group.<br><br></details>        
        <details close><summary id="np">Bond 3 &#9660;</summary>With Isami Kondo left as the sole leader of the Shinsengumi, Toshizo became second in command. The group continued policing rogue samurai and protecting the city under the orders and direction of Toshizo. Though the Ikedaya Affair is what made the military group famous, Toshizo had not been part of the squad sent on that mission; instead, he and his own squad were hot on the trail of samurai elsewhere. When he received notice about the incident and went to provide reinforcements, he secured the surronding area before going inside the building.
            <br><br>After power shifted to the emperor, the Bosin War broke out between the new government and the old shogunate, taking place mainly across the Satsuma Domain, Choshu Domain, and Tosa Domain, among others. Toshizo took control of the Shinsengumi in place of Isami, who had been injured in an attack, and directed the old shogunate's army from area to area. After gaining control of Ezo, he was ordered to take charge of the military and security division. He was killed on the frontline at what was to be the final battlefield of the Boshin War, in Goryokaku, Hakodate.
            <br><br>In ALICE, Toshizo looks over the battle division, and always has victory in her sights. If necessary, she will act coldly even toward her own allies. As long as it doesn't contradit with her aims and beliefs, however, she will do everything in her power to protect those on her side and save them in times of troubles, revealing she does indeed have a kind-hearted side of her. Her generally harsh attitude means that it can be difficult for those on the receiving end of her kindness to see it, though.<br><br></details>

            Born Ushiwakamaru, he came to be known as Shana-oh during his temple stay, and then as Minamoto no Yoshitsune when he took up the family name. Though he perfomed many heroic deeds during the Genpei War, he eventually angered his brother Yoritomo and took his own life at the age of 31.<br><br></details>
        <details close><summary id="np">Bond 2 &#9660;</summary>Ushiwakamaru was the ninth son of Minamoto no Yoshitomo. His father died in the Heiji Rebellion when he was just two years old. From around the age of eleven, he was raised by the monks at Kurama Temple in Kyoto. Not wanting to become a monk, however, Ushiwakamaru eventually left for Hiraizumi with the assistance of Fujiwara no Hidehira.
            <br><br>Around this time, he met his longstanding retainer Benkei Musashibo, who is said to have accepted this position after Ushiwakamaru defeated him at Gojo Bridge, where he had been up to no good.
            <br><br>Ushiwakamaru later hurried to join his older brother Yoritomo, who sent for his assistance against the Taira clan in battle. While he was there, another ally, Kiso Yoshinaka, decided to turn against Emperor Go-Shirakawa. Ushiwakamaru, however, took him down.
            <br><br>History tells us that upon receiving orders to take out the Taira, Ushiwakamaru managed to deliver outstanding results: his troops won the Battle of Mikusayama in a daring nighttime attack, the Battle of Ichi-no-Tani in a surprise assault from the clifftops, and the Battle of Yashima amid a fierce storm. Ushiwakamaru chased after the Taira from the Seto Inland Sea to the island of Hikoshima in Shimonoseki and finally defeated them in the battle at Dan-no-Ura.<br><br></details>        
        <details close><summary id="np">Bond 3 &#9660;</summary>Emperor Go-Shirakawa conferred rank and status upon Ushiwakamaru for his successful defeat of the Taira. These rewards, however, raised Yoritomo's suspicions since they were accepted without his permission.
            <br><br>Yoritomo began to question Ushiwakamaru's loyalty, and remembered how Ushiwakamaru had always acted on his own, placing little importance on Yoritomo's commands. Yoritomo feared his younger brother's military genius and resented him for denying his vassals the opportunity to distinguish themselves on the battlefield.
            <br><br>His suspicions came to a boiling point one day when Ushiwakamaru refused orders on the grounds of an illness. Not believing him, Yoritomo sent troops in retaliation. Ushiwakamaru and those loyal to him were forced to take up arms and flee to Hiraizumi in Oshu.
            <br><br>In the end, Ushiwakamaru is said to have been cornered in the Buddhist hall of Koromogawa Palace, where he ended his life with his own sword. Some, however, believe that it took too long to send proof of Ushiwakamaru's suicide, and that this shows he actually escaped alive and became an Ainu god or Genghis Khan.
            <br><br>In ALICE, Ushiwakamaru still seems to carry the trauma of her brother's disbelief with her. Perhaps her tragic death is why she now always seeks the approval of others and actively finds problems to solve, so much so that she has made quite the name for herself in downtown ALICE.<br><br></details>

            A Dutch painter of the mid-17th century often cited as a representative of the Baroque period. He is best known for his ability to capture realism, his techniques in creating depth of space and his mastery of textures through depictions of light. Despite his talents and the quality of his work, there was a time when he was quite obscure due to the state of oligopoly in the art world.<br><br></details>
        <details close><summary id="np">Bond 2 &#9660;</summary>The mysterious artist by the name of Johannes Vermeer. Who he studied under and what kind of personal life he led remain a mystery in the present day. Despite this, he is very well-known as he gained significant financial success with the creation of the "Girl with a Pearl Earring" and "Woman Pouring Milk", two pieces characterized by his signature use of bright blue paint, which was a very expensive resource at the time.
            <br><br>However, entering into the 18th century, his paintings would become forgotten and he would fall into obscurity due to the fact that his work did not conform to ideals proposed by the Academy at the time. His works would only be viewable in private collections and would not come back into the limelight until the 19th century, when the Revolution broke the privatization of the art world and brought French art to the people.<br><br></details>        
        <details close><summary id="np">Bond 3 &#9660;</summary>There are a handful of public records and other sources of information that give a glimpse of his life. However, self portraits, diaries, letters and other such documents that would provide a view of his personal life have been impossible to find. Some may argue that his mysterious nature is what creates his appeal.
            <br><br>The Vermeer of ALICE, on the other hand, is very energetic and friendly, a total "open book". Perhaps this is a reaction to her enigmatic history, or possibly a result of the nature of her paintings being relatable and representative of everyday people. She has been lucky enough to find a wonderful group of friends and continues painting pictures that capture the vividness of ALICE's landscape.<br><br></details>

        <details close><summary id="np">Bond 2 &#9660;</summary>No one knows where exactly Viviane's lake is located. Perhaps it does not exist at all, for the tales describe it as a mystical lake created by sorcery.

Learning of this incident, Merlin leads Arthur to the lady of the Lake. While some stories say the sword she bestows to Arthur is Excalibur, others say Excalibur  was reforged from the damaged remains of the sword in the stone.

Arthur was gravely injured in the ensuing Battle of Camlann, and he set off for Avalon. According to myth, Viviane was the one who showed him the way.

            A mysterious Folklore whose name originates in the German festival known as Saint Walpurgis Night (also known as Saint Walpurga's Eve). She is highly skilled in the art of attracting and alluring others, whether that be with bad or good intentions.<br><br></details>
        <details close><summary id="np">Bond 2 &#9660;</summary>The Walpurgis in ALICE is heavily influenced by both Saint Walpurga and the witches of Walpurgis Night. Walpurga was a missionary from England dispatched to Germany and the then Frankish Empire. After her death, she was awarded sainthood and her relics were sent back to England on the 1st of May. In the past, Europeans viewed sunset as the start of the new day, so the night of April 30th was dubbed "Walpurgis Night". The same night was also when witches would allegedly congregate to celebrate the coming of spring before disbanding at sunrise. This belief would be combined with Walpurgis's Folklore incarnation, making for an interesting and bizarre pairing of a saint and a witch in the same person.<br><br></details>        
        <details close><summary id="np">Bond 3 &#9660;</summary>Walpurgis can more often than not be found in the night areas of ALICE. She likes to hold banquets for Walpurgis Night and invites people to her nighttime area to celebrate. Her mysterious personality and suspicious-looking invitations can often put her invitees off and stir up trouble, but her actions are anything but, and typically involve detoxing unnecessary data from Avatars, among other harmless effects. Though Walpurgis Night is associated with witches, Walpurgis is also associated with Saint Walpurga, and the young girl doesn't perform anything remotely witchcraft-like. This disconnect between her image and her actions actually fascinates Walpurgis, so she doesn't attempt to clear the air about herself.<br><br></details>
